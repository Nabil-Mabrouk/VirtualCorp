- Smart Contracts: Enforce rules and compliance in interactions.
- Pipeline: Chain contracts for complex business processes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtualcorp.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd virtualcorp`
3. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Run: `python src/app.py`

## Usage
- You can customize the program by modifying the app.py file and the prompts.py file
- Define agents with specific roles and models.
- Create contracts to control agent interactions.
- Chain contracts in a pipeline for multi-step processes.
- Collaborate with language models to automate tasks.
